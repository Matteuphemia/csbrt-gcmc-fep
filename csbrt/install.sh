# required:
#
#   $ENV/lib/libc10.so, libtorch*.so   conda 2.10, the C++ layer sire/loch link
#                                      against. loch dlopens libc10.so lazily,
#                                      inside the GCMC sampler.
#   site-packages/torch/               pip 2.7.1+cu126, what OpenFold3 imports.
#
# They never collide because OpenFold3 (preprocess) and loch GCMC run in separate
# processes and never co-load. Do NOT "clean up" the conda pytorch: removing it,
# or deleting $ENV/lib/libtorch*.so / libc10*.so, leaves every import passing and
# then fails mid-GCMC with `libc10.so: cannot open shared object file`.
